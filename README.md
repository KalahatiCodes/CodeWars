Lessons Learned:
What's cool about Codewars is that it challenges me to find multiple approaches at tackling the same problem. Because each Kata is created by one person (usually), they use the way that would solve a code challenge and in order to recieve that Kata as the challenger I must use their solution. So, in may cases a problem is presented and I know exactly how to solve it and it's a breeze... but it returns red/incomplete because the way I solve it differs from the creator. This is great because it pushes me to find a variety of ways to achieve one solution. This mental flexibility is applicable to the skills needed to work in groups and also to create code that is informed by the rest of the code files present. Pretty cool right?!
